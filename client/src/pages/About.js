                <h4>
                Talking Trees believes that the more the talk about trees the more we will appreciate them - one individual tree can touch so many individual lives.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In a future of uncertainty and change, we are experiencing unprecedented biodiversity loss and unparalleled ecosystem destruction. Globally, we lose an entire football field of trees every second. We believe that a multifaceted approach of protection, restoration and rehabilitation is critical for conservation.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But, we need your help. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Together we can place value on the trees we already have, whilst imagining a future with even more trees, and even more stories.
                <br></br>
